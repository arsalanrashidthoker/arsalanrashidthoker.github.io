        <h1> Who am I? </h1> <hr>
        <h4> Hello! I'm Arsalan Rashid Thoker. I design and develop websites. I'm a first year student at NIT, Srinagar persuing Electrical Engineering. I'll graduate in 2023. I work on various college and external projects. I have been doing web designing and development since 2019, and I've mastered it till now. I use various techniques recommended by top web designers, to make your website more appealing and interactive. I assure my clients a top quality service, that too at very cheap rates. </h4> <br>
        <h1> Why do I charge less? <h1> <hr>
        <h4> Charging less than the market value make the clients skeptical about the quality of services, but I got an answer for that. Since I'm a college student yet, I don't work merely for earning money but its my passion. I don't require money right now, that's why I charge only to value the time I devote on working your project. I don't compromise on the quality of my work, I even charge only after the client likes the design. I provide free trials to gain the trust of the client. In nutshell you can trust my work, I assure you, you'll never regret that. On the contrary, you'll assign me more and more tasks after I finish the first project with you. </h4>
